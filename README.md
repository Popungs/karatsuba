# karatsuba
Karatsuba Algorithm in CPP

This code in theory should compute multiplication in run time of O(n^1.58) instead of O(n^2). <br/>
But due to its memory usage it is highly unlikely that it would perform in O(n^1.58) runtime. <br/>

To execute the code: <br/>
Compile codes with gcc or g++ compiler.<br/>
Execute binaries and input two integers.
